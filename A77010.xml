         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is nothing more plauſible, nothing more commendable, and nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in the publike eye of the world, then the impartiall equity of Juſtice, embraced by ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Officers. But <hi>e contra,</hi> on the other ſide, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more exploded, nothing more ignominous, and nothing laſtly more deſpicable in the common deteſtation, and epidemicall contempt of all men, then the diſparity of injuſtice executed by them. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officers are but <hi>Vice-gerents</hi> from Superiors, and if a blinded error, or temerarious relapſe bee committed by the former, it muſt needs conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reflected on the latter. So that their offence is not ſo great, <hi>quo peecaverunt ſeipſi, ſed quo peccata ſuae in alios injiciunt,</hi> is that they have offended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but in that the aſperſion of their own offence is caſt upon others.</p>

            <p n="4">4 Their abuſe of connivance to the rich, exclaims highly againſt them, and becomes ſo obſtreperous, that it cryes for neceſſary, and dependent urgency of Juſtice againſt them, according to their impious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits. The rich, able, and ſufficient men were excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed oftentimes, and poore men were then coactively urged to pay for them.</p>
            <p>Thus like fortune, <hi>ubi nihil, aut minimum eſt, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt, ubi omnia, aut ſaltem maxima ſunt, addunt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius:</hi> they take away from thoſe who have nothing, or very little, and adde more to thoſe, who have all things, or at leaſt the greateſt. And their offence is ſo vicious in this regard, that I bluſh, or at leaſt am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to adde any further a conſtructive addition to their coniving malignity.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In ſaving themſelves from all paiments whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they were very officious in their Offices; and whether poore or rich, the wealthy, or indigent did pay, they would be ſure to pay nothing themſelves: yea ſometimes they would detaine money too, and putting it up into their own purſes, they would often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay (poor honeſt men) that they were willing to pocket up ſuch wrongs as thoſe. So that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the Pariſh did yearly pay more then the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of them. And this was a moſt ſhamefull, unbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and intollerable abuſe, and is ſo baſely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to their Offices, that nothing but juſt execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be reflected on them, for their ſo voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinded equity and injuſtice. I muſt retract my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating pen a while, leſt it ſhould digreſſe in a too diſtant aberration from thoſe three in that former Propoſitions. I muſt therefore recall my ſelf to the
<pb facs="tcp:156376:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 52 -->explication of the cauſe of thoſe numerous varieties of corruptions; The generall and prime cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeriouſly conceive from their too licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in committing thoſe errors without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, prohibition, or oppoſition: So that the continuance of their corruptions, and duration therof without interdiction, was the chiefeſt cauſe of the varieties that deſcended from that inhumanity: and a ſecond cauſe may be deducted from the <hi>non annuall election</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore theſe precedent particulars being maturely, and ſeriouſly conſidered, and revolved by the City: All the old Common-Councell-men were arreigned by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens, and conſequently a ſelect Committee was appointed to meet at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> to regulate theſe abuſes, which have bin by them committed. And being accuſed, they were found ſo inexcuſable delinquent and peccant, they were incontinently excluded from their corrupt Offices, and New Common-Councell-men elected in their Places.</p>
